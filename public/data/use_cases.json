    "Remarks": "Papua New Guinea faces significant safety and accountability challenges in the public motor vehicle (PMV) sector, with many buses operating without proper licensing or in dangerous mechanical conditions, creating risks for passengers and owners. Road crashes remain a major cause of death in PNG, with recent PMV incidents involving brake failures and multiple fatalities. Additionally, vehicle theft, misuse, and poor service plague PMV owners due to lack of monitoring capability. This use case introduces a fully digital PMV system that verifies driver identities, provides real-time bus tracking, and enables passenger safety verification through SevisPass integration. Drivers authenticate using verified SevisPass digital IDs, preventing unlicensed and unsafe operators from operating vehicles. Vehicle profiles are digitally linked to ownership records and maintenance history, creating transparency and accountability. Real-time GPS tracking allows owners to monitor bus location and behavior, reducing theft and misuse. Passengers can confirm driver identity before boarding and use SMS emergency alert functionality to report safety concerns. The system includes community-based driver rating mechanisms and SMS emergency notifications integrated with SevisPass. Unlike manual, uncoordinated approaches, this comprehensive digital ecosystem provides transparency, prevents illegal operation, reduces vehicle misuse, and dramatically improves safety outcomes",

    "Remarks": "Papua New Guinea is designated by the World Health Organization as a High Burden Country for tuberculosis, with children representing approximately 26% of reported TB cases—the highest proportion globally. The primary challenge is treatment non-adherence due to social issues, stigma, and lack of support, resulting in \"lost-to-follow-up\" patients who continue spreading TB in communities. This use case leverages SevisPass and SevisWallet to improve TB treatment completion rates and transparent incentive delivery. When a child visits a clinic with a parent/guardian, SevisPass enables instant identification and linking to health records. TB test results are sent through the patient's digital ID, determining treatment initiation. Treatment adherence is monitored through daily clinic check-ins, with missed doses triggering healthcare worker outreach and contact tracing. SevisPass geodata features flag high-risk transmission zones, activating identification of close contacts who receive SMS alerts for TB testing. Crucially, conditional incentives for successful treatment completion are linked to parents' or guardians' bank accounts through SevisPass/SevisWallet integration, verified through carer credentials with financial institutions. This transparent, traceable system increases treatment completion rates by approximately 15% while reducing stigma and discrimination through verified, automated processes.",

    "Remarks": "Papua New Guinea's healthcare system currently relies on fragmented paper-based patient records that are easily lost, damaged, or inaccessible when urgently needed. This significantly impacts rural communities who often travel long distances for care. SevisHealth solves this by creating a unified national health information platform that uses SevisPass Digital ID as the secure entry point for patient registration and verification. Clinics can instantly confirm patient identity using verified national data rather than manual forms or duplicates. Each person is linked to one accurate digital health profile accessible across participating hospitals and clinics. The system operates on Oracle's Autonomous Database with secure APIs for reliability and data protection, enabling clinical staff to retrieve records in seconds. Rural clinics can work offline and sync automatically when reconnected. To ensure inclusive access, SMS reminders and USSD service enable patients without smartphones to check appointments, vaccination schedules, and clinic details via basic mobile phones. By integrating SevisPass digital identity, secure data-sharing, offline-ready tools, and multi-channel access, SevisHealth improves medical record-keeping, accelerates clinical decisions, and strengthens healthcare access across PNG.",

    "Remarks": "Senegal's agricultural sector faces critical post-harvest losses reaching 50-70%, making farmers vulnerable to predatory lenders and forcing extremely low sales while preventing customers from accessing quality food at reasonable prices. \nThis concept integrates refrigerated and other food grain warehouses with a digital ID-enabled app to provide a comprehensive solution. Farmers use digital identity to create a profile on the app, which ensures a trusted account. This app then shows vacant space in nearby warehouses which is either owned by the government or registered under the responsible agency. The farmer then can book storage space based on its requirement in advance based on his/her harvest estimate, by paying some booking amount. Once the farmer gets booking confirmation with a deadline to showup at the facility, so that space is not being wasted.  The warehouse also provides assess to online marketplace in lieu of some fees and hence help farmers to access better prices. \nIn order to ensure transparency and accountability government can regulate that all food grains stored in these facility must be linked to a farmers digital ID. In failure to do so, these warehouses will be either fined or deregistered from the government-authorized warehouse list. Regular audit will be done with random farmers being present to authenticate their product through face verification.",

    "Remarks": "West African farmers face limited market access, a lack of transaction transparency, and trust issues from fraudulent practices. The absence of unified digital platforms prevents product showcase, access to agricultural news, and farmer-buyer connections. These challenges prevent income generation and perpetuate poverty. FarmPlace transforms agriculture by utilizing national digital IDs to create secure farmer profiles through an application that farmers can access themselves. For registration, farmers will use OTP-based authentication. The platform includes an agricultural marketplace that allows farmers to set up personalized online stores, as well as a resource hub featuring agricultural news, best practices, and grant information, all posted by experts from an agricultural university. Mobile-first design ensures rural accessibility with local language support. Once a profile is made, farmers can log in using their password. Farmers can upload the crops or other harvested product information like photographs, quality, etc. The genuineness of the information can be authenticated using digital ID credentials and OTP. Verified digital identities enable access to financial and government services, thereby strengthening farmer resilience while reducing the likelihood of fraudulent transactions.",

    "Remarks": "Across many African nations, legacy paper-based driver licensing systems are plagued by corruption and the proliferation of fake documents. Without reliable tools to verify these licenses roadside, traffic officers cannot detect suspended drivers or forged permits, significantly increasing road safety risks. To address this, the Transport Authority can implement a digital licensing system that integrates with the national MOSIP platform as a Relying Party. When a citizen applies, the system uses MOSIP’s e-KYC service to verify their identity and automatically populate trusted demographic data, ensuring the applicant is a real person. The Authority then issues the license as a cryptographically signed credential, available either in a digital wallet app or printed as a secure QR code on a physical card for non-smartphone users. Traffic police can scan these codes using a verification app that checks the digital signature instantly, allowing for authentication even in offline areas without internet access. This architecture anchors every license to a verified identity, prevents forgery, and drastically reduces roadside corruption by removing human discretion from the verification process.",

    "Remarks": "Africa's smartphone penetration is at its all-time high and is expected to increase further. However, smartphone users face battery drain challenges, with smartphone batteries depleting within 7 to 8 hours as the phones get older. One of the prime reasons is the background work of many apps which cause hardware issues along with storage getting depleted.\nThis usecase idea proposes to integrate digital id with the operation of all the apps to streamline the user experience along with optimising the device operation. This app allows for digital ID-based registration to other third-party apps and manages the cookie and other settings based on the user's predefined preferences. The app provide one stop solution for digital id based credetial verification and authentication required for different types of apps.\nThis application also addresses powerdraining issues by enabling battery usage monitoring with detailed statistical breakdowns, battery health monitoring with proactive alerts, optimization recommendations for high-draining apps, battery usage pattern analysis, customization options based on user preferences, battery saver automation at defined percentages, direct system settings integration, and power saving modes. Application provides comprehensive battery management without additional hardware costs. Research ongoing for power storage integration with device batteries. Accessible, user-friendly interface facilitates digital ID application usage on mobile devices without interruption. Combines existing battery optimization features (Greenify, AccuBattery, DU Battery Saver) into single comprehensive solution.",

Rather than relying on physical ID cards, this platform requires the telecom agent to capture the user's live biometrics (such as fingerprints or facial scans) along with their unique national ID number at the point of sale. \nThe collected biometric data is sent to the national ID system, which performs a 1:1 biometric match to verify the individual's identity. The platform also features logic flows that mandate fresh biometric authentication for sensitive actions, such as SIM swaps, to ensure that only genuine mobile numbers are linked to their respective national IDs. \nDuring mobile money registration, a similar biometric authentication is executed by the telecom operator after 24 hours to ensure that the mobile number and digital ID belong to the rightful owner. Mismatched or repeated registration attempts trigger fraud alerts.",

    "Remarks": "Agriculture in many African countries lacks integrated farmer registration, verification, and profiling systems, limiting efficient input distribution, access to finance, and market access. \nThis use case proposes a digital ID-enabled farmer registry system that creates verifiable farmer profiles and documents transaction history. Farmers are registered on the platform by a network of agents using the National Digital ID credentials and its biometric authentication facility. The digital ID is linked to the individual farmer profile created using demographic data collected and verified by agents during the in-person visit. The profile records essential data, including personal information, land ownership (verified against government records), primary crops, farm size, and farming practices. The platform also integrates financial information linked to farmers' tax credentials, such as credit rating and annual income. This creates a complete, up-to-date Agroeconomic profile of a farmer, which can be shared with recognized public and private authorities upon OTP-based authentication by farmers linked to the national digital ID. This enables banking institutions to assess farmer creditworthiness accurately, governments to distribute subsidies directly, and insurers to design farmer-specific products. The system can also be further developed to ease supply chain issues faced by farmers. The farmer profiles can also be used to document agent-verified product varieties and quality available with them, enabling online market access and intermediary bypass for better prices. Personalized farmer profiles enable targeted training from governments and NGOs on specific crops and practices.",

Farm2Global is a digital marketplace that utilizes trusted digital identity systems to connect smallholder farmers with global clients through export agencies. \nFarm2Global registers and authenticates farmers using a Unique Identification Number (UIN) linked to national digital ID credentials or MOSIP-based digital ID modules. It issues each farmer a Verifiable Credential (VC)– backed digital ID, enabling trusted cross-border transactions and product traceability. Once a farmer’s profile is created, they can submit evidence of their crop varieties and production capacities for specific periods. This evidence can include images, videos, and a site visit conducted by one of our representatives to review and approve the quality of their products.",

    "Remarks": "To address the lack of electricity access in rural Morocco, solar energy programs offer subsidized solar installations to farmers with registered farmland. However, farmers cannot prove land ownership due to a lack of a formal title to the rural land. \nThis idea proposes to integrate Morocco's CNIE digital ID to formalize land rights and allocate solar installations. Government agents will map land boundaries using mobile apps in the presence of community leaders and all relevant parties. The verification of the title holder is conducted through CNIE facial recognition, and therefore, land ownership is authenticated via CNIE facial recognition during enrollment. Verified land receives a unique digital land ID, which is linked to the farmer's CNIE ID via OTP on the linked phone. These land IDs are categorized by use, including farmland, residential, or other.\nBased on the analysis of this data, the energy department will provide subsidised solar installations based on land use, size, and agricultural potential. For instance, high-value farmers are included in the solar-powered irrigation program; a group of vulnerable households receives rooftop panels; community infrastructure receives larger microgrids, and so on. Solar kits are assigned through one-time CNIE biometric verification at installation.",
